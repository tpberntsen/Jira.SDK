<h2>Getting started</h2>
To get started with this SDK, all you need to do is create a new Jira instance and choose how you want to target Jira:

```C#
Jira jira = new Jira();
//Connect to Jira with username and password. Please be aware that the information returned by the Jira REST API depends on the access rigths of the user.
jira.Connect("{{JIRA URL}}", "{{USERNAME}}", "{{PASSWORD}}");

//You can also connect to Jira anonymously. Please make sure that the information you want to request with the SDK is accessible by unauthenticated users.
jira.Connect("{{JIRA URL}}");

//Gets all of the projects configured in your jira instance
List<Project> projects = jira.GetProjects();

//Gets a specific project by name
Project project = jira.GetProject("{{projectname}}");
            
//Gets all of users favourite filters
List<IssueFilter> filters = jira.GetFilters();

//Gets a specific filter by name
IssueFilter filter = jira.GetFilter("{{filtername}}");

//Get a list of agile boards configured in your jira instance
List<AgileBoard> agilaboards = jira.GetAgileBoards();

//Get a specific issue with key
Issue issue = jira.GetIssue("{{issuekey}}");

//Add a new issue to a project
Project project = jira.GetProject("{{projectname}}");
Issue newIssue = project.AddIssue(new IssueFields()
{
                Summary = "Summary of the new issue",
                IssueType = new IssueType(0, "Type"),
                CustomFields = new Dictionary<string, CustomField>() {
                    { "customfield_11000", new CustomField(11000, "Value") }
                }
            });
);
```
